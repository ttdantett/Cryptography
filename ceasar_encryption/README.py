## Usage version 1
cipher = encrypt("ceci est le texte Ã  chiffrer",4)
plain = decrypt(cipher, 4)

## Usage version 2
cipher = encrypt2("ceciestletexte",4)
plain = decrypt2(cipher,4)

## Advises
You can put any characters in the alphabet in the version 1
The version 2 requires characters from 'a' to 'z' or 'A' to 'Z'
The size is the key, must be the same in ecnryption and decryption
